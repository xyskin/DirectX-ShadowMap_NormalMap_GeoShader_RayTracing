# DirectX-ShadowMap_NormalMap_GeoShader_RayTracing
You need DirectX SDK environment

This Repository has 2 context.
One is Rasterization Pipeline which refers to RasterTek and Microsoft Documents.
Second is Ray Tracing which I was working recently.
It will output a PNG image names RayTracing.png
These works together, so it would be a HUGE lag renderring the scene when running this program.
